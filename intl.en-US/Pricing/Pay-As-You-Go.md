SLB is billed based on traffic usage.

## Billing items {#section_e22_ggs_wdb .section}

The cost of an SLB instance is the sum of the following billing items. The billing items vary by the network type and instance type as shown in the following table.

**Note:** “-” means that the corresponding item is not billed and “✔” means that the corresponding item is billed.

|Network type|Instance type|Instance fee|Traffic fee|Specification fee|
|:-----------|:------------|:-----------|:----------|:----------------|
|Internet|Shared-performance instances|✔|✔|-|
|Guaranteed-performance instances|✔|✔|✔|
|Intranet|Shared-performance instances|-|-|-|
|Guaranteed-performance instances|-|-|✔|

## Instance fee {#section_a1f_lgs_wdb .section}

The instance fee is the public IP reservation fee of Internet SLB instances.

**Note:** Intranet SLB instances are free of instance fee.

Instance fees of Internet SLB instances are billed as follows:

-   Instance fee = unit instance price x instance reservation time

    The reservation time is the period from the time the instance is created to the time the instance is released.

-   Instance fees are billed on an hourly basis. In a billing cycle, partial hours are billed as full hours.


If the price on the purchase page is different from the price listed in the table, take the price on the purchase page as the standard.

|Region|Instance fee \(USD/hour\)|
|:-----|:------------------------|
|China \(Hangzhou\)/China \(Beijing\)/China \(Shenzhen\)/ China \(Shanghai\)/China \(Zhangjiakou\)|0.003|
|China \(Qingdao\)|0.003|
|Hong Kong|0.009|
|US \(Virginia\) /US \(Silicon Valley\)|0.005|
|Singapore|0.006|
|Japan \(Tokyo\)|0.009|
|Germany \(Frankfurt\)|0.006|
|UAE \(Dubai\)|0.009|
|Australia \(Sydney\)|0.006|

## Traffic fee {#section_c1f_lgs_wdb .section}

Traffic fees are charged based on the traffic usage of Internet SLB instances.

**Note:** Intranet instances are free of traffic fee.

Traffic fees of Internet SLB instances are billed as follows:

-   Internet traffic fee = unit traffic price x usage time

    Internet traffic is the outbound \(downstream\) traffic. Inbound \(upstream\) traffic is not included in the cost.

-   Traffic fees are billed on an hourly basis. In a billing cycle, partial hours are billed as full hours.

    If the price on the purchase page is different from the price listed in the table, take the price on the purchase page as the standard.

    |Region|Traffic fee \(USD/Gbps\)|
    |:-----|:-----------------------|
    |China \(Hangzhou\)/China \(Beijing\)/China \(Shenzhen\)/China \(Shanghai\)/ China \(Zhangjiakou\)|0.125|
    |China \(Qingdao\)|0.113|
    |China \(Hong Kong\)|0.156|
    |US \(Virginia\) /US \(Silicon Valley\)|0.078|
    |Singapore|0.117|
    |Japan \(Tokyo\)|0.120|
    |Germany \(Frankfurt\)|0.070|
    |UAE \(Dubai\)|0.447|
    |Australia \(Sydney\)|0.096|


## Capacity fee {#section_r13_y1h_j2b .section}

The following are three key performance metrics for guaranteed-performance instances. The limits of these metrics are different for instances of different capacities. For more information, see [Guaranteed-performance instances](../intl.en-US/User Guide/Server Load Balancer instance/Guaranteed-performance instances.md#).

-   Max Connection

    The maximum number of connections to a SLB instance. When the maximum number of connections reaches the limits of the capacity, the new connection will be dropped.

-   Connection Per Second \(CPS\)

    The rate at which a new connection is established per second. When the CPS reaches the limits of the specification, the new connection will be dropped.

-   Query Per Second \(QPS\)

    The number of HTTP/HTTPS requests that can be processed per second. This metrics is only available for Layer-7 Server Load Balancer. When the QPS reaches the limits of the specification, the new connection will be dropped.


The capacity fee of a guaranteed-performance instance is charged based on usage regardless of the capacity that you choose. If the actual performance metrics is between two capacities, the cost is calculated according to the larger capacity.

For example, the capacity slb.s3.large \(1,000,000; CPS 500,000; QPS 50,000\) is selected. The actual usage of your instance in an hour is as follow:

|Max Connection|CPS|QPS|
|:-------------|:--|:--|
|90,000|4,000|11,000|

-   From the perspective of Max Connection, the actual metrics 90,000 occurs between the limit 50,000 defined in the Standard I \(slb.s2.small\) capacity and the limit 100,000 defined in the Standard II \(slb.s2.medium\) capacity. Therefore, the capacity of the Max Connection metrics in this hour is Standard II \(slb.s2.medium\).

-   From the perspective of CPS, the actual metrics 4,000 occurs between the limit 3,000 defined in the Small I \(slb.s1.small\) specification and the limit 5,000 defined in the Standard I \(slb.s2.small\) specification. Therefore, the specification of the CPS metrics in this hour is Standard I \(slb.s2.small\).

-   From the perspective of QPS, the actual metrics 11,000 occurs between the limit 10,000 defined in the Standard II \(slb.s2.medium\) capacity and the limit 20,000 defined in the Higher I \(slb.s3.small\) capacity. Therefore, the capacity of the QPS metrics in this hour is Higher I \(slb.s3.small\).

    Comparing these three metrics, the specification of the QPS metrics is highest, therefore, the specification fee of the instance in this hour is charged at the price of the Higher I \(slb.s3.small\) specification.


The following figure is an example showing how the specification fee is billed for an SLB instance:

The billing of the guaranteed-performance instances is flexible.  The capacity you select when purchasing an instance is the performance limitation of the instance. For example, if slb.s3.medium is selected, the new connections are dropped when the HTTP requests in one second reach 30,000.

The price in the following table is only for reference. Take the price on the console as standard.
